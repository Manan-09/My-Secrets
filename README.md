# My-Secret 
**My-Secret** is a secure application for storing and managing your sensitive data. My-Secret leverages Spring Security to provide comprehensive access control and authentication for your sensitive data. It ensures that your data is stored in an encrypted manner using MongoDB as the data storage solution and requires JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to access the data. Additionally, Redis is used for caching to provide faster response times.
